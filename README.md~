# DT-webgallery
Simple web-gallery for Darktable
## What?
The plan is to make a basic, lightweight responsive layout relying only on html5 and CSS3 for darktable. Because i want to avoid using .js depencies, the navigation is going to be very basic and straightforward. 

## Look?
- The focus has to be on the photos, not the pages. 
- The photos have to be displayed as big as possible in the viewport.
- Titles and text could be desplayed on a:hover / tap
- There could be some sort of menu, but i think its unnecessary. However, there could be an index file linking to a look book, made up of .html sidecarfiles. (see todo)

## TODO
- Ask DT-devs if possible to render one page per photo.
